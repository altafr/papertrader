- **Last updated:** 2026-08-22.

## Delivery Roadmap

### Phase 0 — Foundation and Setup

#### 0.1 Source foundation — first action

- [x] Initialize this directory as a Git repository and set `main` as the default local branch.
- [x] Scaffold a strict TypeScript workspace with `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `apps/worker`, and shared packages for domain contracts, database access, Alpaca normalization, and configuration.
- [x] Create the Next.js dashboard in `apps/web`; keep API, scheduling, broker access, and worker code out of the frontend package.
- [x] Add root scripts for typecheck, lint, tests, and production builds without adding Alpaca credentials or order submission.
- [x] Commit the existing context pack and the compiling scaffold as the recoverable baseline.

**0.1 exit gate:** All three applications compile locally, shared contracts import cleanly, no secret or broker call exists, and the baseline commit is reproducible.

#### 0.2 Hosted foundation

- [x] Create/connect the remote source repository.
- [x] Push the baseline and protect the remote `main` branch.
- [x] Create the Vercel project for `apps/web` with preview and production environments.
- [x] Create one Railway project with separate `api`, `worker`, and PostgreSQL services.
- [x] Keep PostgreSQL private to Railway services; expose only the API health surface pending Phase 1 authentication.
- [x] Configure local development, Vercel preview/production, and Railway production-paper variables without any live-trading configuration.

#### 0.3 Technical selections

- [ ] Select and record the Next.js/Railway-compatible single-operator authentication provider.
- [ ] Select and record the PostgreSQL migration/ORM library.
- [ ] Select and record the PostgreSQL-backed durable job-queue library.
- [ ] Select and record the runtime schema-validation and decimal-arithmetic libraries.

#### 0.4 Security and paper-account setup

- [ ] Create or reset the Alpaca paper account to the `USD 1,000` baseline.
- [ ] Add paper credentials only to Railway service variables and require `ALPACA_PAPER_TRADE=true`.
- [ ] Add placeholders/documentation—not values—for required environment variables.
- [ ] Verify Vercel, browser bundles, source control, logs, and PostgreSQL contain no Alpaca credentials.

#### 0.5 Operational decisions

- [ ] Review and approve Version 1 scope and the initial paper risk policy.
- [ ] Decide the default emergency-stop response before implementing paper execution.
- [ ] Select the Alpaca market-data subscription/feed.
- [ ] Select critical alert providers and at least two eventual critical-alert paths.

#### 0.6 Phase 0 verification

- [ ] Verify local typecheck, lint, tests, and production builds.
- [ ] Verify Vercel preview deployment and Railway API/worker health endpoints.
- [ ] Verify Railway PostgreSQL connectivity through private networking.
- [ ] Enable scheduled database backups and record the later restore-drill requirement.
- [ ] Record exact results and remaining decisions before starting Phase 1.

**Phase 0 exit gate:** The versioned scaffold deploys safely, Vercel can reach only the authenticated Railway API, Railway services can reach private PostgreSQL, secrets are correctly isolated, and no Alpaca order capability exists.

### Phase 1 — Trusted Read-Only Foundation

- [ ] Add single-operator authentication and authorization.
- [ ] Create the initial PostgreSQL schema, migrations, constraints, indexes, least-privilege roles, and append-only audit events.
- [ ] Add server-only Alpaca paper-account adapter.
- [ ] Display account status, equity, cash, buying power, positions, orders, and activities.
- [ ] Add health, freshness, paper-mode banner, and reconciliation status.
- [ ] Verify browser bundles/logs never contain Alpaca secrets.

### Phase 2 — Market Data and Dashboard

- [ ] Add stock/crypto asset discovery and eligibility filters.
- [ ] Add historical bars/snapshots through protected server calls.
- [ ] Add supervised market/trading WebSocket worker with backfill.
- [ ] Build Overview, Positions, Orders & fills, Performance, and Alerts views.
- [ ] Reconcile dashboard/account data against Alpaca.

### Phase 3 — Strategy and Replay Foundation

- [ ] Implement versioned strategy plug-in interface.
- [ ] Implement decimal-safe performance and risk metrics.
- [ ] Build historical replay with point-in-time inputs, fees, and slippage.
- [ ] Implement three initial momentum research strategies.
- [ ] Add strategy lifecycle: disabled → replay → shadow → paper → eligible live.

### Phase 4 — Research Agents and Daily Preparation

- [ ] Implement orchestrator and structured agent-run records.
- [ ] Add stock and crypto research agents with read-only tools.
- [ ] Add macro advisory and economic-event context.
- [ ] Produce persisted daily stock and continuous crypto plans.
- [ ] Add agent health, evidence, and audit views.

### Phase 5 — Risk and Paper Execution

- [ ] Implement immutable signals and trade intents.
- [ ] Implement versioned deterministic risk engine and paper defaults.
- [ ] Add idempotent paper execution service.
- [ ] Add order/trade stream handling and full reconciliation.
- [ ] Test rejected orders, partial fills, timeouts, duplicates, and restarts.

### Phase 6 — Durable Autopilot

- [ ] Add durable schedules, retries, dead-letter handling, and recovery.
- [ ] Implement Observe, Recommend, and Paper Autopilot mode gates.
- [ ] Verify Paper Autopilot submits deterministically approved paper orders without per-order human confirmation.
- [ ] Verify daily server jobs run independently of the dashboard and expose last-run/next-run health.
- [ ] Add pause, kill switches, cancel-only, liquidation, and safe resume.
- [ ] Configure/test critical alerts.
- [ ] Run continuously in paper mode and collect operational evidence.

### Phase 7 — Live Readiness (Separate Approval Required)

- [ ] Complete at least 30 consecutive calendar days stable paper operation.
- [ ] Pass all architecture live-readiness gates.
- [ ] Review performance across regimes with realistic costs and sample sizes.
- [ ] Approve risk limits, limited-capital rollout, and rollback plan.
- [ ] Complete security, dependency, backup, and recovery review.
- [ ] Implement Live Confirm before considering Live Autopilot.

## Completed Build Unit — Phase 0.1

- **User-visible outcome:** A truthful foundation page identifies Paper, Read-only foundation, and No broker connection states.
- **Boundaries created:** Next.js web, Node API, inactive worker, domain contracts, database placeholder, Alpaca placeholder, and server configuration.
- **External effects:** None. No hosted resource, database, credential, Alpaca request, or order behavior was created.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Git repository uses local `main` as its default branch.
  - [x] Web, API, worker, and shared package boundaries compile.
  - [x] Browser code has no database or broker dependency.
  - [x] API `/health` returns a healthy foundation response.
  - [x] Worker reports both database and Alpaca as `not_configured` and exits.
  - [x] Typecheck, lint, unit tests, and production builds pass.

## Phase 0.2 Review Handoff

- **User story:** As the operator, I have an isolated Vercel frontend and Railway API/worker/PostgreSQL foundation connected to version-controlled deployments, with no broker access.
- **In scope:** Remote repository, protected `main`, Vercel project, Railway API/worker/PostgreSQL services, private networking, and environment separation.
- **Out of scope:** Authentication implementation, Alpaca credentials or calls, database domain schema, market streams, agents, strategies, risk, and order behavior.

## Completed Hosted Unit — Phase 0.2

- **Source control:** Baseline pushed to `altafr/papertrader`; remote `main` requires pull requests, enforces administrator protection and conversation resolution, and rejects force-pushes and deletion.
- **Delivery branch:** `chore/phase-0-2-hosting`; draft pull request `#1` remains open for review and merge.
- **Vercel:** `papertrader-web` is connected to the GitHub repository with `apps/web` as root, shared workspace sources enabled, and dependency-aware builds. Production and preview deployments are Ready; deployment protection remains enabled.
- **Railway:** Project `papertrader` contains healthy `api`, `worker`, and PostgreSQL services. The API alone has a public domain; worker and PostgreSQL have none.
- **Environment safety:** API and worker use `APP_ENVIRONMENT=production-paper`, `TRADING_MODE=paper`, and `BROKER_CONNECTION_ENABLED=false`. No Alpaca variable, credential, client, request, or order path exists.
- **Persistence boundary:** The worker now stays online only to serve `/health`; it reports database and Alpaca adapters as `not_configured`.
- **Merge handoff:** After pull request `#1` is merged, change both Railway Git sources from `chore/phase-0-2-hosting` to `main` and verify one clean deployment before Phase 0.3.

## Next Build Unit — Phase 0.3

- **User story:** As the operator, I have explicit, recorded technical choices for authentication, PostgreSQL access/migrations, durable jobs, runtime validation, and decimal-safe finance calculations.
- **In scope:** Compare candidates against the existing Next.js/Vercel and Railway/PostgreSQL architecture, record decisions and tradeoffs, and add no broker access.
- **Out of scope:** Implementing authentication, database schema, queues, Alpaca connectivity, strategies, risk, or order behavior.

## Open Questions

| Priority | Question | Impact | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Which Next.js/Railway-compatible authentication provider will protect the single-operator application? | Identity, authorization, re-authentication | Operator |
| P1 | Which PostgreSQL migration/ORM and durable job-queue libraries will be used? | Schema evolution, transactions, retries, and recovery | Operator |
| P1 | Which Alpaca market-data subscription/feed will be used? | Coverage, latency, entitlements, and tests | Operator |
| P1 | What exact cancel/liquidate action should the global emergency stop perform by default? | Loss containment and operational safety | Operator |
| P2 | Which alert channels should receive critical incidents? | Response time | Operator |
| P2 | What stock and crypto universe/liquidity thresholds should be used for initial research? | Strategy capacity and data usage | Operator |
| P2 | Which macro/news sources supplement Alpaca news, if any? | Advisory coverage and external cost | Operator |

## Decisions Made

| Date | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-08-21 | Version 1 is paper-only. | Validate behavior and safeguards without real-capital exposure. |
| 2026-08-21 | Runtime uses protected Alpaca APIs; MCP supports research/operator workflows. | Development-client MCP connections are not deployed-app runtime services. |
| 2026-08-21 | AI agents cannot directly approve risk or bypass execution gates. | Keep financial authority deterministic, bounded, and auditable. |
| 2026-08-21 | US stocks and crypto use separate parameters and exposure caps. | Their sessions, liquidity, volatility, and market structure differ. |
| 2026-08-21 | No browser-hosted continuous loop. | Browser sessions are not reliable always-on infrastructure. |
| 2026-08-21 | Server-side daily operation is required. | Preparation, health, reconciliation, and evaluation must continue without an open browser. |
| 2026-08-21 | Paper Autopilot needs no per-order operator confirmation. | Deterministic risk approval and all safety gates remain mandatory. |
| 2026-08-21 | Initial paper equity is USD 1,000; estimated planned-stop loss is capped at the lower of 0.25% equity and USD 100. | Preserve conservative proportional risk while adding an absolute loss ceiling. |
| 2026-08-21 | Vercel is the selected frontend host. | Next.js/Vercel provides a conventional maintainable application and deployment path for the operational dashboard. |
| 2026-08-21 | Railway PostgreSQL is the Version 1 system of record. | PostgreSQL supplies transactional constraints, reconciliation queries, backups, and direct integration with the Railway API/worker stack. |
| 2026-08-21 | Railway hosts the API, durable job processor, and always-on WebSocket worker. | Consolidating the backend reduces integrations while retaining persistent server processes. |
| 2026-08-21 | Use a pnpm strict TypeScript workspace with separate web, API, worker, and shared packages. | Enforce deployment and permission boundaries before adding integrations. |

## Verification Status

| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Context consistency | Pass | Six controlling files re-read before Phase 0.1 implementation |
| Typecheck | Pass | `pnpm typecheck`; 7 workspace projects passed |
| Lint | Pass | `pnpm lint`; zero warnings |
| Tests | Pass | `pnpm test`; 3 files and 4 tests passed |
| Build | Pass | `pnpm build`; shared packages, API, worker, and Next.js production build passed |
| Runtime smoke | Pass | Web returned HTTP 200; API `/health` returned healthy; worker reported integrations not configured |
| Remote source | Pass | `altafr/papertrader` baseline pushed; protected `main`; draft PR `#1` contains Phase 0.2 changes |
| Vercel production | Pass | `papertrader-web` production deployment Ready |
| Vercel preview | Pass | Preview deployment `dpl_CJ52EHx8fvznZGX6tDbreHhfN35F` Ready; access remains protected by Vercel |
| Railway services | Pass | API, worker, and PostgreSQL deployments all report `SUCCESS` in `us-west2` |
| Railway API health | Pass | `https://api-production-e0a6.up.railway.app/health` returned HTTP 200 and healthy JSON |
| Railway private boundary | Pass | PostgreSQL and worker have no public domain; only API public networking was created |
| Alpaca paper connection | Not run | Credentials/backend not configured |
| Browser/preview | Partial | Production page HTTP check passed; visual/responsive review deferred beyond source scaffold |
| Security review | Partial | No credential files, Alpaca client, database connection, or order code added; full review remains required |

## Known Risks

| Severity | Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Duplicate or unintended live orders | Paper default, environment isolation, idempotency, live gates |
| P0 | Agent bypasses risk controls | No direct order permission; deterministic risk/execution boundaries |
| P0 | Stale or incomplete market/account state drives entry | Freshness checks, stream-gap detection, backfill, fail closed |
| P1 | Paper results overstate live performance | Model fees/slippage/fills; limited live rollout only after validation |
| P1 | Background process stops silently | Durable jobs, worker health, heartbeats, alerts, reconciliation |
| P1 | Broker/internal state diverges | Alpaca treated as truth with scheduled/event-driven reconciliation |
| P1 | Strategy overfits historical data | Holdout periods, multiple regimes, paper-forward validation, versioning |

## Session Handoff

- **What exists:** Verified Phase 0.2 source, Vercel, Railway API/worker, and private PostgreSQL foundation with no broker access.
- **Where to resume:** Review and merge draft PR `#1`, repoint Railway API/worker Git sources to `main`, verify deployments, then begin Phase 0.3 selections.
- **Important context:** Keep Alpaca paper mode and read-only behavior during Phase 1.
- **Recommended next prompt:** Review and merge Phase 0.2, then start Phase 0.3 technical selections.
